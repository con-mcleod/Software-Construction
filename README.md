# Software-Construction

This repository holds some of my learnings during the UNSW course COMP2041: Software Construction: Techniques and Tools. This course used multiple languages: Bash, Perl, Python, Flask, Jinja, SQL, HTML, CSS, C, and others as needed, and was a very useful course that I would highly recommend.

My key learnings from this course were the ability to automate processes using a variety of scripting languages, how to better navigate the command line, and more generally, a range of processes which I believe make me much more effective and efficient when programming.

I completed two assignments in this course, the first being a python to perl translator, and the second being a small social media webapp for which I received a grade of 90.
